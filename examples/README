TODO
what are the scripts/started
how to use the scripts/started
  common conventions (parameters, config files, etc)
  myaccount.yml (note about quoting strings)...maybe a link to yaml site
description of each script/started...just guessed from the filenames mostly :P
  length of the descriptions should be...???...
"going further" section w/links to perl and glc beginner dev material
does this section need it's own license?
  Should that be in every example script?
  Is it already?



INTRO
This directory contains several functional examples of using
Games::Lacuna::Client. To use them, you will need to have a working copy of
perl and cpan installed. See the installation notes in the top-level README.

'Learning more/help' resources may go here but probably in the root instead:
  modern perl and other free and/or high-quality references
  the understanding's site/at least that blog post about installing glc in
    windows, which should actually go in this repo's root README in a
    section for install notes
  lacuna developers page with the links to forums, api docs, repos, etc
  #glc on freenode or #lacuna or whatever it was...is that alive yet?
